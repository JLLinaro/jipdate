Hi all,

This is the status update from me for this week. I've been mostly working with

for each and every Jira issue I'm working with below.

Joakim!

[SWG-25]
This is my superduper comment

It can contain empty lines        many space, and even references
to other issues like [LHG-52].

[SWG-26]
This issue is currently blocked.

But we intend to work with it after issue [SWG-200].

[SWG-27]
No updates this week
